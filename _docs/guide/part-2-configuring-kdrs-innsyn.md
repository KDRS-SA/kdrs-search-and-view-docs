Now we will log into KDRS S&V and setup a company (archive) and an account to use.

1. By default only the admin account exists. Log into the admin account by clicking OK after entering the default credentials:\
E-mail:   `admin@kdrs.no`\
Password: `admin`\
<br>

2. **IMPORTANT**: Now we have to change the admin password from the default one to a secret, secure one. Click "Admin" in the top right to open the navigation menu and navigate to "Brukere".\
