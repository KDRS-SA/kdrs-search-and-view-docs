Shows a preview of the data.\
This is typically used if the number of choices are few, and the user does not need to search for the data.\
For sensitive data its recommended to disable the preview and require a spesific search.

Example:
{% highlight xml %}
    <table>
        <preview>false</preview>
{% endhighlight %}
